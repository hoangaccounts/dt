# SOLID Principles

**Source:** Clean Code, Clean Architecture (Robert C. Martin)

Always apply all five principles:

- **SRP (Single Responsibility):** One reason to change per class
- **OCP (Open/Closed):** Open for extension, closed for modification
- **LSP (Liskov Substitution):** Subtypes must be substitutable for base types without altering correctness
- **ISP (Interface Segregation):** Many specific interfaces better than one general interface
- **DIP (Dependency Inversion):** Depend on abstractions, not concretions; high-level modules don't depend on low-level modules
