# Chat Begin Checklist

## Purpose

This checklist ensures every chat session starts with proper context and clear goals. Run through these items at the beginning of each session to maximize effectiveness and avoid miscommunication.

## Start of Session Checklist

### 1. ✓ Confirm Context Loaded
**AI Assistant confirms:**
- [ ] I have read and understood all foundation documents
- [ ] I have read personal-background.md (if applicable)
- [ ] I have read technical-skills.md (if applicable)
- [ ] I have read project context.md (if continuing existing project)

**Example confirmation:**
> "I've loaded your context:
> - Foundation: development-philosophy, working-style, design-standards, code-standards
> - Personal: background and technical skills
> - Project: GoodStocks context with 3 previous sessions
> 
> Ready to proceed."

### 2. ✓ Review Project Status
**For existing projects:**
- [ ] What was accomplished in last session?
- [ ] What decisions were made?
- [ ] Where did we leave off?
- [ ] Any blockers or questions from last time?

**For new projects:**
- [ ] Review project goals
- [ ] Confirm project type and approach
- [ ] Understand constraints

### 3. ✓ Confirm Session Goals
**User states:**
- What do we want to accomplish today?
- Any specific features or problems?
- Time available for session?
- Desired deliverables?

**AI confirms understanding:**
> "Got it - today we're implementing offline sync for GoodStocks. 
> Goal: Complete repository pattern with Room integration.
> Deliverable: Working code with tests.
> Correct?"

### 4. ✓ Note Skill Gaps for Teaching
**AI identifies:**
- [ ] Any technologies/patterns user is learning?
- [ ] Should I explain more or assume knowledge?
- [ ] Teaching opportunities in this session?

**Based on technical-skills.md:**
- Known beginner areas → teach/explain
- Known expert areas → minimal explanation
- Unknown areas → ask first time encountered
