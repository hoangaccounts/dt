## Purpose

This guide defines **what makes a good session summary** and how to structure it so future AI sessions can reliably build on past work.

**Goal:** Create concise, actionable summaries that preserve decisions and eliminate repeated discussion.

---

## Relationship to Chat Annotation Protocol

This document defines **summary content quality and structure only**.

All mechanics for capturing notes, proposing updates, confirmations, and end-of-chat workflows are governed by:

**workflow/chat-annotation-protocol.md**

If there is any conflict, the protocol is authoritative.

---

## When to Summarize

Summaries are produced via the `@summary` command defined in the chat annotation protocol.

Always summarize when:
- Ending a productive session with decisions made
- Architecture or design choices were established
- New patterns or conventions emerged
- Important problems were solved
- Approaching token limits
