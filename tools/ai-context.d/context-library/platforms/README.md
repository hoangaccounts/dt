# Platforms

Platform-specific implementation guides and troubleshooting docs.

## Status: NOT LOADED BY AI-CONTEXT YET

**These files are currently NOT automatically loaded by `dt ai-context`.**

To use them:
1. Manually paste relevant files into AI chat when needed
2. Or update `foundation-loader` to add `platforms/` support (future work)

## Structure

Organized by platform:

- `github/` - GitHub Actions, branch protection, workflows
- `android/` - Android-specific build, testing, deployment

## What Goes Here

Platform-specific tactical knowledge:
- Setup procedures that are error-prone
- Troubleshooting guides for specific tools
- Implementation patterns for specific platforms
- "How to avoid spending 2 days on X" docs

**NOT for timeless principles** - those go in `sw-foundations/`

## Future Platforms

Add folders as you encounter them:
- `aws/` - Lambda, S3, etc.
- `docker/` - Compose, networking, etc.
- `ios/` - iOS-specific guides
- etc.
